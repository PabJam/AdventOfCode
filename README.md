This is the combined repository of the years where I participated in Advent of Code.
The solutions are all a bit messy and unoptimized, because it's just the first thing I came up with, which worked.
The code may be a bit incoherent but that's part of the fun.

What is Advent of Code?
From their website (https://adventofcode.com/2025/about):
"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware."
